# quiz-base-api

---

This repository contains the code for the quiz-base-api, an application for quickly creating quiz games.

## Idea

The main idea behind this application is to provide a convenient way to create and manage quiz games. Users can download
the app, upload their questions and answers, and the application will handle the backend functionality to make it all
work.

_(at least that's the idea)_
